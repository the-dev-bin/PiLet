## Three parts

## The frontend

* Problem: User needs to be able to schedule their device to turn on.
* Solution build an app using ionic to interface with a backend written in Flask to schedule events
  * Step 1: Prototype using figma \

  * Step 2: Identify framework
    * Used ionic for the easy capability to transfer to an android app in the future
  * Step 3: Build the thing!
  * Step 4: Revel in the glory of site being done

## The Backend
* Problem: Interface between User application and PI.
* Solution: Using flask create an API to handle user data with PI data.
*  Created endpoints on cloud server and used nosql via a single json file to manage user start and end times.

## The Pi
* Problem: Pi must control outdoor outlet via statebased relay.
* Solution: Using a Songle SRD-05VDC-SL-C and a Raspberry Pi Zero W. Utilizing python with RpI.GPIO library and the 5v GPIO signal pins from the PIZero create an IoT outlet that can be controlled by the PI.
* Large amount of hardware work required to safely implement the PI for outdoors.
* See Slideshow for a more indetail aproach on how it was physically built.
