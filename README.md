## The Backend

## The Pi
* Problem: Pi must control outdoor outlet via statebased relay.
* Using a Songle SRD-05VDC-SL-C and a Raspberry Pi Zero W. Utilizing python with RpI.GPIO library and the 5v GPIO signal pins from the PIZero create an IoT outlet that can be controlled by the PI.
* Large amount of hardware work required to safely implement the PI for outdoors.
* See Slideshow for a more indetail aproach on how it was physically built.
